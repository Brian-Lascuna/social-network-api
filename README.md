# Social Networking API

## Description
A social networking API designed using MongoDB and Mongoose with the intention of practicing using said technologies to create and manipulate databases for the server-end of a website. In this case, MongoDB/Mongoose controls the information of users such as their username, email, thoughts, and friends. As of currently, only the data of users is working with the rest to be implemented in the future.

## Installation
All packages can be installed via the 'npm install' or 'npm i' commands.

## Usage
This project was conducted using Insomnia to test the routes. You can start the server using the 'npm run start' command and send HTTP requests via your program of choice.
